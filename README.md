# covid19_metastability_website
Simulation website for our publication **TODO add link and doi**.
The website uses webassembly for the simulations and the highcharts libary for plotting.
The model code just like the dgl solver can be found in the `assets/cpp` folder.



It is possible to use this website offline if you run a local http server, simply opening the html file with a browser does
**not** work. For example this can be done with python `python -m http.server`.
